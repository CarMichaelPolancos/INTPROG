1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?
readyState only shows the current state of the request while status shows the HTTP response code from the server.

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?
By setting the third parameter of xhr.open() to true, like this:
xhr.open("GET", "url", true);
This means the script continues running while waiting for the serverâ€™s response.

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
It prevents the webpage from freezing while waiting for a response. Users can still interact with the page while data loads in the background. It also improves user experience and performance.
